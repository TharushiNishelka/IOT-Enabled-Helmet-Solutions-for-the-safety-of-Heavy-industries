# IOT Enabled Helmet Solutions for the safety of Heavy industries

## Introduction 

In response to challenges identified in Heavy industries such as mining, oil, gas, steel, chemicals, and construction, our team, TEAM INVENTIFY has executed a cutting-edge solution. Key issues include

 -communication difficulties due to noise

 -unmonitored exposure to hazardous gases

-falls leading to injuries

-inconsistent adherence to helmet-wearing regulations.

To tackle these, we execute a multi functional device attachable to construction helmets. This device will facilitate clear communication through noise-resistant channels, detect hazardous gases, alert to falls, monitor helmet usage, and be sustained by a solar charging system. This initiative aims to significantly improve on-site safety and compliance, ensuring a robust response to common construction site hazards and communication barriers, all while maintaining regulatory adherence. 


## Key Features

1. Communication Enhancement: 

The Smart Helmet serves as a communication hub with built-in IoT-enabled devices. Wireless communication allows real-time information exchange among construction team members, and facilitates team-specific communication through IoT-enabled break-out channels, enhancing coordination among teams engaged in diverse tasks like excavation, framing, electrical work, and plumbing overcoming the challenges posed by noise and distance. 

2. Safety Monitoring: 

Gas Detection:

 Integrated sensors detect the presence of poisonous gases, providing immediate warnings to workers and supervisors. 

Fall Detection: 

Accelerometers and gyroscopes enable fall detection, triggering instant alerts and facilitating rapid response in the event of a worker falling.

The device incorporates GPS technology to track the location of workers in real-time. This feature ensures that team leaders can monitor the whereabouts of their team members, improving overall coordination and response times in emergencies. 

3. Regulatory Compliance Monitoring: 

Helmet Presence Sensors: IoT sensors monitor whether the worker is wearing the helmet. Non-compliance triggers warnings and alerts to the worker and the team leader, ensuring adherence to safety regulations. 

In summary, our Smart Helmet solution leverages IoT technology to create a connected and intelligent safety system for construction sites and heavy industries. By addressing communication gaps, safety hazards, and regulatory compliance, this solution aligns with the transformative principles of Industry 4.0, leading to safer and more efficient construction practices.

TEAM INVENTIFY was honored to be selected as a finalist from the university category in the prestigious SLIOT competition for our groundbreaking project, GuardianHelm. 


SLIoT Challenge 2023 is an annual IoT Competition which is organized by the Department of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Moratuwa in collaboration with SLT-MOBITEL and The Institution of Engineers Sri Lanka (IESL). The goal of this competition is to raise awareness about "Internet of Things" (IoT) and encourage its usage among Sri Lankans.The organizers expect to evaluate IoT based solutions that can be developed up to industrial level standards, which address major issues in the world. Each year, a theme is announced conveying the problem scenario. 

This recognition not only validates the innovation and hard work we poured into the development of the Smart Helmet but also underscores its potential to make a significant impact in its respective fields. Being among the finalists in such a competitive arena speaks volumes about the quality and ingenuity of our project, further motivating us to continue pushing boundaries and striving for excellence.
